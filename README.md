# react-tutorial-es2015

An ES2015 implementation of the official React tutorial; https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

## Setup

This is a lightweight setup leveraging [jspm](http://jspm.io/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [system.js](https://www.google.de/search?q=system.js&oq=system.js&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.1774j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8).

All you should need to do is pull down this repo, and then;

```bash
npm install
jspm install
npm run serve
```

This should launch a local http server running on port `8080`
